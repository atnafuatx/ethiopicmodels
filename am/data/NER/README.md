# Benchmark dataset for Amharic NER
The Amharic named entity dataset is annotated within the SAY project at New Mexico State Universityâ€™s Computing Research Laboratory was used. The data is annotated with six classes, namely `person`, `location`, `organization`, `time`, `title`, and `others`. 

There are a total of `4237` sentences where `5480` tokens out of `109,676` tokens are annotated as named entities. The dataset is represented in `XML format` (for the different named entity classes) and is openly available in this [GitHub](https://github.com/geezorg/data/tree/master/amharic/tagged/nmsu-say) repository. We have converted the data into the `CONLL` data format

This is the first benhcmark dataset (split into train/development/test sets) with the SOTA results based on our [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/13/11/275)
